# Student portal
## Improved proof of concept
This is a new proposal of student portal architecture. 

Purpose of this small project is to give hints to other developers how problems on our student portal could be resolved.

Problems we suffer:
* To hard to understand logic
* Big javascript files doing multiple things
* Autogenerated javascript files

Adding new functionality takes enormous amount of time and debugging existing issues is very slow.

How to fix these issues:
* Introduce [knockout components](https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html) which will encapslate logic it only cares about (single responsibility)
* Introduce [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/). It will help us divide our application into small modules and load them on demand without worying about which javascript file depends on other file (dependency injection). 

## How to run this application

You will need http server in order to make ajax requests. 
You can deploy this app to IIS server, but there are simpler solutions:

### VS Code exapmle:
If you have **Visual Studio Code** installed, there is an extension for hosting simple http server with live-reloading feature.

After installing this extension you can start live server by clicking on "Go Live" button on the status bar:

You can then browse the application on 127.0.0.1:5500

### Python example:
You can also use one-liner command in [python](https://www.python.org/) in your commandline to host simple http server in current directory:
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
Example:

You can then browse the application on 127.0.0.1:8080

## The application:

The application shows it's features on simplified recreation of _Apply Now_ section. 

Features implemented:
* Application is divided by small self-contained components
* Loading data dynamically via ajax call
* Dynamic component loading
* Cross component communication using events
* Passing data to child components via properties
* Asynchronous module loading by RequireJS
* Each component has its own small state
* Whole _Apply Now_ section has access to it's child viewmodels to gather all information needed before submit.
